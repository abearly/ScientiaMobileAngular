# ScientiaMobile AngularJS Practical Tests

There are three AngularJS practical tests included in this repository.

Each uses [Laravel 5.3](https://laravel.com/docs/5.3) for their back-end, however, knowledge of Laravel is not required. All necessary back-end components have been set up as needed for each exercise.

Specific instructions are included in each exercise.

Setup is required prior to attempting these exercises.

## Setup
These exercises will require global dependencies and exercise-specific dependencies.

### Dependencies
These should be installed prior to attempting the exercises.

1. Download and install [composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
2. Download and install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

The following versions are known to work:
* composer: 1.5.0
* Node.js: 8.7.0
* npm: 5.6.0
* gulp: 3.9.1 (local version)

Any other versions may cause issues in setup.

### Installation
These steps should be done for each exercise.

1. Install composer dependencies:
`composer update`
2. Install node modules:
`npm install`
3. Compile assets:
`gulp`

## API

Parts of these exercises will require the use of an API. This will be provided, and the documentation can be found in [API.md](API.md).
